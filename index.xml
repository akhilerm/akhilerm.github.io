The below steps outline how a local registry can be deployed with a self signed certificate.
Create a directory for storing the registry data, certificates and authentication data. mkdir -p ./my-docker-registry/{auth,certs,data} Now create the authentication data using htpasswd docker run --rm --entrypoint htpasswd httpd:2 -Bbn &amp;lt;user&amp;gt; &amp;lt;password&amp;gt; &amp;gt; .</description></item><item><title> Unforgettable Moments and New Milestones: My First KubeCon Experience</title><link>https://akhilerm.com/posts/my-first-kubecon-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2023 16:14:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://akhilerm.com/posts/my-first-kubecon-experience/</guid><description>Embarking on a journey to the United States for the first time, my anticipation was heightened by the fact that I will be giving my first international conference talk. Being awarded the Dan Kohn scholarship was not just a financial aid but a ticket to an experience that would unfold as a series of remarkable moments. The scholarship allowed me to be a part of KubeCon, a colossal event in the realm of Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies.</description></item><item><title>Understanding OCI Image Spec</title><link>https://akhilerm.com/posts/understanding-oci-image-spec/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 16:14:55 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://akhilerm.com/posts/understanding-oci-image-spec/</guid><description>As part of understanding the OCI image spec, I found that a good explanation of the image spec will help others. Explaining a few things here, which I found a little bit difficult to grasp while reading the spec.
Image Format The spec defines an OCI image. This image spec is almost similar to Docker V2.2 image schema format. Image services like containerd can pull this image, and then create a bundle (more on this as I learn about it).</description></item><item><title>The 6 blind men</title><link>https://akhilerm.com/posts/the-six-blind-men/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 20:15:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://akhilerm.com/posts/the-six-blind-men/</guid><description>NOTE This story has an abrupt ending because I woke up suddenly in the middle of the night.
